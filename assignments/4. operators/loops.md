1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here
```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
// your code goes here
```
<!-- for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) { 
        if ( i%2 ) {
            alert(`${i} is odd`);
        }
        else {
            alert(`${i} is even`)
        }
    } 
-->

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
<!-- 
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) { 
    console.log (`${i} * 9 = ${i*9}`);
} 
-->

4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)
<!-- for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j<=10; j++) {
        console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${i*j}`);
    }
} -->

5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Your code goes here
```
<!-- 
for (i=1; i<=10; i++){
    sum +=i;
    if (i==5){
        sum +=("\n");
    }
    if (i!=5 && i!=10){
    sum +=(", ");
    }
} -->

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// Your code goes here
```
<!-- 
let i=1;
let sum=0;
while(i <= 20) {
  sum = sum + i;
  i = i + 1;
}
console.log(sum); -->

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here
```
<!-- 
let i = 1;
while (i <=20) { 
  if(i%2 == false){
      console.log( i );
  }
  i++;
} 
-->
